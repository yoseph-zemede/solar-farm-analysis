# SolarFarm-Analysis

Welcome to the SolarFarm-Analysis project repository! This project aims to analyze environmental data related to solar farms in Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo, with the goal of identifying high-potential regions for solar installation and providing data-driven recommendations for sustainable energy solutions. This is part of 10 Acadamy and Kifya Aritificial Intelligence Mastery Course Program.

## Business Objectives

MoonLight Energy Solutions aims to develop a strategic approach to significantly enhance its operational efficiency and sustainability through targeted solar investments. As part of this initiative, our task is to perform a quick analysis of environmental measurements provided by the engineering team and translate our observations into a strategy report. The analysis and recommendations must align with the company's long-term sustainability goals.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **notebooks**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, and visualization tasks.
- **scripts**: Contains Python scripts for various data processing, analysis, and visualization tasks.
- **data**: Contains the dataset used in the analysis (not included in this repository).
