- Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI)
- Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI)
- Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI)
- Module temperatures (TModA, TModB)
- Ambient temperature (Tamb)
- Wind speed (WS, WSgust, WSstdev)
- Wind direction (WD, WDstdev)

## File Structure

- Each CSV file represents data collected from a specific location or time period.
- The columns in the CSV files correspond to different environmental measurements.


## Usage

- Download the dataset files to your local machine for analysis.
- Use the data files in conjunction with the provided Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts in the `notebooks` and `scripts` folders for analysis and visualization tasks.
